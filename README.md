# IEEE_Public_Listing_Database
Basically a collection of IEEE's Public Listing ID's for a MySQL database.

I created this so that I could have a local copy that I could use to quickly look up ID's without having to go out to IEEE's site. 
I mainly wanted to have the ethernet MACs and fiber channel WWNs, but decided to add the other ones as well. Here is the list of assignments from IEEE's site that I included:

IEEE MA-L Assignments 
IEEE MA-M Assignments
IEEE MA-S Assignments 
IEEE IAB Assignments 
IEEE CID Assignments 
IEEE Ethertype Assignments 
IEEE Manufacturer ID Assignments 
IEEE Operator ID Assignments 
IEEE Logical Link Control Assignments
IEEE Standards Group Assignments
IEEE STID Assignments
